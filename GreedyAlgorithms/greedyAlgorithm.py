What is Greedy Algorithm?
'''
# It is an algorithmic paradigm that builds the solution piece by piece
# - In each stap it chooses the iece that offers most obvious and immediate benefit
# - It fits perfectly for those solutions in which local optimal solution lead to global solution

# What problems can be solved useing greedy algorithm

# - Activity selection problem 
# - Coin change problem 
# - Fractional knapsack problem

Greedy algorithms
'''
# - Inserton Sort - divide array into sorted and unsorted (finds local optimal solution at each step)
# - Selection Sort - divide array into sorted and unsorted (finds min element and put it into sortedArray)
# - Topological Sort - check if each element lead to local solution then we take it otherwise we ignore it
# - Prim's Algorithm - find minimum spanning tree 
# - Kruskl Algorithm - find minimum spanning tree (each step finding local optimum solution (minimum edge))
