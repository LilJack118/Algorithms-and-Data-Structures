All pair shortest path problem
'''
# WHAT IS SINGLE SOURSE SHORTEST PATH?
# A single sourse problem is about finding a path between a given vertex (called source) to all other
# vertices in a graph such that the total distance between them (source and destination) is minimum.

# Practical example:
# - Five offices in different cities
# - Travel costs between these citeis are known
# - Find the cheapest way from head office to branches in different cities


# WHAT IS ALL PAIR SHORTEST PATH PROBLEM
# All pair shortest path problem is about finding a path between EVERY VERTEX to all other vertices in 
# a graph such that the total distance between them (source and destination) is minimum

# The problem:
# - Five offices in different cities
# - Travel costs between these citeis are known
# - Find the cheapest way to reach each office from EVERY OTHER OFFICE


'''
Dry run for all pair shortest path problem
'''
# - take all graph vertices as a source vertex and itertate through 
# them checking shortest paths for each of them
