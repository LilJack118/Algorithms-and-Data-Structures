What is Backtracking?
'''
# A backtracking algorithm is a problem-solving algorithm that uses a brute force approach for finding
# the desired output.

# 1. Backtracking chacks whetehr the given node is a valid solution or not
# 2. Discard several invalid solutions with one iteration
# 3. Enumerate all subtree of the node to find valid solution
